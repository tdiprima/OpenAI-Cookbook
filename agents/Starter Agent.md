## 🛠️ "Starter Agent" in Python

### ✨ What This "Agent" Actually Does:
- **Classifies** your input into "question" or "request" 🧠
- **Handles** it differently based on what it thinks it is ✅
- **Self-manages** with just two API calls 🔥
- **No frameworks. No LangChain. No fancy memory.**  
- **Pure vibes + working code.**

---

## 🧩 Notes:
- It's **"agentic"** because it's *reasoning + planning*.
- If you want it even FASTER, switch `"gpt-4o"` to `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`.
- You can expand it easily: add tools, routing, retries, logging, memory... but you don't have to today. 🧘‍♂️
