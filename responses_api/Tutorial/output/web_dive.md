Answer: As of March 19, 2025, several significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have been announced:

**Nvidia's Next-Generation AI Chips**

At the GTC 2025 conference, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the company's upcoming AI chips, Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin. These chips are designed to meet the increasing demand for computing power required by advanced AI systems. The Vera Rubin AI chip is slated for release in late 2026, with the Rubin Ultra following in 2027. Huang emphasized the evolution of AI from perception and computer vision to generative and agentic AI, capable of reasoning and understanding complex contexts. Nvidia also introduced the Isaac GR00T N1, an open-source model for developing humanoid robots, and the Newton physics engine for robotics simulation, developed in collaboration with Google DeepMind and Disney Research.

**Google's AI Models for Robotics**

Google has launched two new AI models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, based on the Gemini 2.0 model, to support the rapidly expanding robotics industry. Gemini Robotics is an advanced vision-language-action model for physical actions output, while Gemini Robotics-ER enables advanced spatial understanding and program development using reasoning abilities. These models are designed to support diverse robot types, including industrial humanoids, and can help startups reduce costs and accelerate market entry.

**Evo 2: AI in Genetic Code Modeling**

A collaborative team from UC Berkeley, Arc Institute, UCSF, Stanford University, and Nvidia has developed Evo 2, the largest AI model in biology to date. Trained on the DNA of over 100,000 species, Evo 2 can accurately predict the effects of all types of genetic mutations and design new genomes as long as those of simple bacteria. This advancement represents a significant milestone in generative biology, enabling machines to read, write, and think in the language of nucleotides.

**DeepSeek's Impact on AI Education**

Chinese universities have introduced new AI courses based on DeepSeek, a prominent Chinese AI startup recognized as a significant breakthrough in the AI field. Institutions such as Shenzhen University, Zhejiang University, Shanghai's Jiao Tong University, and Renmin University of China are integrating DeepSeek into their curriculum to enhance AI learning and address challenges related to security, privacy, and ethics. This initiative aligns with China's aims to foster scientific and technological innovation for economic growth.
