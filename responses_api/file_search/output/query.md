Assistant response: Deep research by OpenAI is a new agentic capability launched in ChatGPT, specifically designed for conducting multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks. It is an innovative feature that can process a prompt and independently find, analyze, and synthesize information from hundreds of online sources to create detailed reports. Deep research constitutes a significant advancement toward developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), aiming at producing novel scientific research. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals involved in intensive knowledge work across various fields like finance, science, policy, and engineering, necessitating precise, thorough, and reliable research .

Here are some key aspects of deep research:

- **Capabilities**: Deep research can perform extensive investigations across the web in a matter of minutes, delivering comprehensive reports that would typically require many hours of human effort. It leverages reasoning to sift through massive amounts of text, images, and PDFs, pivoting its strategy based on the information it encounters.

- **Applications and Usage**: Users can initiate deep research by selecting the option in the message composer of ChatGPT and entering their query. This feature is useful for a wide range of research tasks, from creating competitive analyses to generating personalized recommendations for complex purchases.

- **Training and Functionality**: It has been trained using end-to-end reinforcement learning on hard browsing and reasoning tasks across various domains. This training enables it to plan and execute multi-step strategies for information retrieval and analysis, including the ability to browse user-uploaded files, generate graphs, and embed data visualizations in its responses.

- **Performance and Benchmarks**: Deep research has achieved new highs in performance on public evaluations designed to test real-world problem-solving abilities. It demonstrated a significant accuracy increase in the Humanityâ€™s Last Exam, scoring 26.6% accuracy, which represents a new benchmark, showcasing its human-like approach in seeking out specialized information.

- **Limitations and Future Directions**: Despite its powerful capabilities, deep research is still early in its development and has limitations, such as occasionally hallucinating facts or making incorrect inferences. OpenAI continues to refine deep research, aiming to expand its access to more specialized data sources and to roll it out across additional platforms and user groups   .

For current and potential users, deep research offers a transformative tool for conducting advanced web research, combining OpenAI's cutting-edge AI models with a depth of web exploration previously unattainable. As this capability continues to evolve, it's poised to unlock new possibilities in knowledge generation and decision-making support.
