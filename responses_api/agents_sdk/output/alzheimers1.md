1. **Title**: Analysis and sample-size determination for $2^K$ audit experiments with binary response and application to identification of effect of racial discrimination on access to justice
   **Summary**: This study involves the methodology for design and analysis of $2^K$ factorial designs, with its focus on binary outcomes, such as the success rate in treatment conditions. While the study doesn't directly deal with Alzheimer's treatment, it presents helpful analysis methodologies that can be applied in the medical field, including Alzheimer's treatment research.

2. **Title**: On the Proportional Principal Stratum Hazards Model
   **Summary**: The paper talks about how an active treatment influences the observed risk of the first non-fatal event, which holds clinical interest. The study introduces the Proportional Principal Stratum Hazards model that estimates the principal stratum hazard ratio, which is essentially the first non-fatal event's direct effect. Although this study doesn't directly relate to Alzheimer's research, the discussed techniques and models can contribute to understanding Alzheimer's disease progression and the effects of its treatments.

3. **Title**: Estimating relapse time distribution from longitudinal biomarker trajectories using iterative regression and continuous time Markov processes
   **Summary**: This paper focuses on biomarkers used for non-invasive monitoring of disease progression. The study proposes a novel iterative regression-based method for estimating changes in patients' status over time, even when including censored patients. The focus is on disease relapse time estimation, making this method potentially useful in monitoring and predicting Alzheimer's disease progression. [Read More](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10448v1)
